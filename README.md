Welcome to the **Telegraf-Telegram-Bot** repository! This project provides a framework for building Telegram bots using [Telegraf.js](https://telegraf.js.org), a modern, flexible, and lightweight library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API.

## Features

- **Full Telegram Bot API support**: Easily access all features of the Telegram Bot API.
- **Middleware architecture**: Handle updates efficiently with powerful middleware.
- **Extensive plugins**: Integrate with various services and platforms using Telegraf plugins.
- **TypeScript support**: Write your bots in TypeScript for enhanced type safety.
- **Easy deployment**: Deploy your bots to platforms like AWS Lambda, Firebase, and more.

## Installation

To get started with Telegraf-Telegram-Bot, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install telegraf
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add telegraf
```

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s a simple example to get your bot up and running:

```javascript
const { Telegraf } = require('telegraf');

const bot = new Telegraf('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
bot.start((ctx) => ctx.reply('Welcome!'));
bot.help((ctx) => ctx.reply('Send me a command!'));
bot.on('text', (ctx) => ctx.reply('Hello World!'));

bot.launch();
```

Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with the token you get from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
